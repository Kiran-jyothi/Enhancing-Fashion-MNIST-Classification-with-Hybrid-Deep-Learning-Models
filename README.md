In this project, I implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models for classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Key Steps:

Implemented Three Models:

Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM
Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)
Trained & Evaluated Models:

Achieved individual accuracies: FCNN (87.5%), RNN (89.7%), CAE (91.6%).
Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Ensemble Model:

Combined predictions of all three models using a weighted average of probabilities.
Improved overall accuracy to 91.93%, outperforming individual models.
This demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble learning in enhancing model accuracy for image classification tasks
